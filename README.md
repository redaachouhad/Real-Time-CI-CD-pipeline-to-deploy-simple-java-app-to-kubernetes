# CI/CD Pipeline for Java Application Deployment to Kubernetes
![0.png](images%2F0.png)
This pipeline is designed to automate the deployment of a Java application to a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline is defined in Jenkins using a declarative pipeline script and performs various stages such as code compilation, testing, security analysis, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes deployment.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and configured.
- Required plugins in Jenkins:
    - Maven
    - SonarQube
    - OWASP Dependency-Check
    - Trivy
    - Docker
    - Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
    - Email Extension Plugin
- Docker installed on the Jenkins agent.
- Kubernetes cluster accessible from Jenkins.
- Docker and Kubernetes credentials stored in Jenkins.

## 2. Pipeline Structure

- **Agent**: Runs on any available Jenkins agent with Java 17 and Maven 3.
- **Environment Variables**: Sets variables like SonarQube details, Docker image name, email configuration, and Kubernetes deployment credentials.

## 3. Pipeline Stages

1. **Clean Workspace**
    - Cleans the Jenkins workspace before starting a new build.

2. **Git Checkout**
    - Checks out the latest code from the main branch of the GitHub repository.

3. **Maven Compile**
    - Compiles the Java project using Maven to verify code integrity.

4. **Maven Test**
    - Runs the test suite to ensure code quality and functionality.

5. **SonarQube Analysis**
    - Analyzes code quality using SonarQube and uploads results for further inspection.

6. **OWASP Dependency Check**
    - Scans the project for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and generates a report.

7. **Trivy Scan Source Code and Dependencies**
    - Scans the source code and project dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

8. **Maven Package**
    - Packages the application into a `.jar` file for deployment.

9. **Build Docker Image**
    - Builds a Docker image from the application, tags it with the latest version, and prepares it for pushing.

10. **Trivy Scan Docker Image**
    - Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities and saves the report.

11. **Push Docker Image**
    - Pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry for accessibility during deployment.

12. **Kubernetes Deployment**
    - Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster by applying Kubernetes resource configurations.

13. **Notifications**:
    - Sends a detailed HTML email to notify recipients of the pipelineâ€™s completion status (success or failure) and attaches vulnerability scan reports.
